Use this as the default project tracker for the AI-assisted development process.

# Development Process

## Process Definition

1. Prompt Spec: Describe the intention and define mocks (store any artifacts in the `spec/` folder if needed).
2. Grill me -> Requirements Specification (use `grill-me`, then `to-prd`): Stress-test the idea and generate a requirements specification (`PRD.md`).
3. Derive Issues/Stories (use `to-issues`): Extract issues/stories and store them in `issues/needs-triage`, or create GitHub issues initially marked as `needs-triage`.
4. Select Core Stories: Choose key stories for prototyping.
5. Architecture Definition (use `grill-me`): Define the architecture and folder/package structure (store in `design.md`).
6. Incremental Implementation & Workflow Management (use `triage`): Triage issues first and route them to `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, or `wontfix`. Once an issue is ready-for-agent, move it into the implementation flow, e.g. `todo -> in-progress -> review -> done`.
   - Use SDD (Specification-Driven Development): Before TDD, explicitly inspect `design.md`, cross-check the planned issue-level design against it, and decide whether issue-level specification and Mermaid diagrams would add value. If they do, recommend that step first, name the diagram types and why they help, and—if the user agrees—use the Mermaid skill to add them inline to the issue markdown file by default. Do not create those diagrams without this consistency check first. Keep them consistent with `design.md`, and if the cross-check finds any inconsistency, omission, or architectural drift, raise the inconsistency explicitly and either update `design.md` now or create follow-up design work if the inconsistency is deferred.
   - Use TDD (Test-Driven Development) (use `tdd`): Implement the stories using TDD.
   - Maintain Design: If difficulties arise or refactoring leads to design changes, update `design.md` accordingly.

## Project Layout

- `devprocess.md` - process tracker
- `spec/spec.md` - prompt spec
- `spec/` - mocks and supporting artifacts
- `PRD.md` - requirements specification
- `design.md` - architecture/design
- `issues/needs-triage/` - local issue store when GitHub is not linked

## Current State

NEXT_PHASE: prompt-spec
NEXT_ACTION: Work with the developer to create `spec/spec.md` and capture any mocks or supporting artifacts under `spec/`.

## Current Summary

COMPLETED:
- None yet.

IN_PROGRESS:
- Project bootstrap.

BLOCKERS:
- None recorded.

OPEN_QUESTIONS:
- Confirm whether the default project layout should be used or overridden.

## Workflow Log

- [bootstrap] Initialized development process tracker. Set `NEXT_PHASE` to `prompt-spec`.

## Guidance for the Agent

- Treat `NEXT_PHASE` and `NEXT_ACTION` as canonical.
- Before changing them, reconcile this file with actual repo artifacts and issue tracker state if available.
- If reality and this file disagree, raise the inconsistency to the user and resolve it collaboratively.
- After a phase is completed, update this file, summarize what finished, announce the next step, and ask: "Shall we proceed?"
```

## Notes

- Keep exactly one `NEXT_PHASE` and one `NEXT_ACTION`.
- Backtracking is allowed by changing `NEXT_*` and logging the reason in `Workflow Log`.
- Prefer updating history and summary instead of inventing extra state markers.
